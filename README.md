# ft_services

This is the ft_services project from the new cursus at 42.

It is dealing with Kubernetes, Ingress, metrics scrapping
with InfluxDB and monitoring with Grafana, and a few other services.

> Note: this was a very research-heavy project, and documentation was sometimes
very hard to find. I liked this project, though.

If you are currently doing this project, feel free to ask me any question on
slack, my username is `cchudant`.
